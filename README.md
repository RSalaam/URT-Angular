# My Todo List

Hello! This is my first Angular application, and I thought a "todo list" would be a great place to start. This is just me practicing, getting an introduction to Angular.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.3.

## Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repo, then run "npm install" 
2. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## If you want to build...

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

I have not created any tests, though I have modified the auto-generated tests to fit this app. You can run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
